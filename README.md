## P3D Clone on TRON

This is a game similar to P3D. It allows you to buy and sell a
token that increases in price when bought and decreases in price when sold. 
It's powered by [TronWeb](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tron-web)
and integrated using [TronLink](https://github.com/TronWatch/TronLink). 
The contract is hosted at TEZRaKqCbUuZN5vnKMjWYWo7r4c92woNsC on TRON Shasta Testnet.
